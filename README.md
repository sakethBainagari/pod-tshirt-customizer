## 💡 Approach & AI Usage

This project was built using React (with Vite) and react-hook-form for robust form validation. The UI is inspired by [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/jkantner/full/OPJrMbp) and adapted for a modern, responsive, and accessible experience. Three distinct themes were implemented, with smooth transitions and Alt+Q switching.

**AI was consulted** for:
- Reviewing code structure and best practices
- Improving form validation logic
- Suggesting UI/UX enhancements
- Drafting documentation and deployment instructions

All code was written and tested by me, with AI used as a coding assistant and reviewer.

  - Lean builds with lower BMI may need to size down
- Displays recommendation in real-time as values change
